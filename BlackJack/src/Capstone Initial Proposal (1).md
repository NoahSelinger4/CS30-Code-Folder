# Outline
#### Basic Description of your project/idea
- I'm thinking of making a game that is like blackjack where a player plays against a dealer to get closer to 21 without going over.

#### Additional Details, how you envision it working, important notes to consider, etc...
- Using an Array or list to order the cards that have been drawn and having separate classes for the dealer and player hands.
- Player and dealer are dealt two cards picked at random.  
- Game decides who is the winner, the player or dealer
- Game is a series of 5.  First to 3 points wins the series

#### Features we MUST include
- Give the player and dealer a hand of cards
- A feature that makes it so you can hit or stand
- A feature that decides who has won the round the dealer or player
- A feature that will keep track of who won the round and give an overall winner when someone wins 3 rounds
- Dealer needs to stand automatically when they are at 17 or higher

#### Feature we would like to include
- A feature that shows the dealer and your hand
- Able to use an Ace like in real blackjack where it can be 1 or 11
- End game right away if your first two cards give you blackjack
- Output the results of each game in the series


#### How will you incorporate each of the following:
**Module 1 - Variables and Output**
- Variables will be used to store the player's hand and the dealer's hand
- The game will output the player's current hand so they can decide to hit or stand
- The game will output who wins each round and who wins the overall series
**Module 2 - Object Orientation and Inputs**
- The game will take input from the player to know if they want to hit or stand
- The game will ask the player to input their name
**Module 3 - Math, Returns, and/or Constructors**
- Math will be used to get a random card 
- The game will return the cards that the player and dealer get to their hands
**Module 4/5 - Conditionals and Loops**
- Conditionals will be used to check the value of the player and dealer's hands and decide who is the winner
- The game will use a loop to keep playing the game until either the player or dealer has won 3 rounds
- The game will use a loop to keep giving the player or dealer a new card until they stand or bust
**Module 6/7 - Arrays OR ArrayLists**
- Array or ArrayList will track who won each game in the series
- 
**Module 8 - Optional: 2D Arrays**
- I don't think this option will be used in the game
- 

#### Language, Code, Platform you plan to use?
- Java on VS code

#### Basic idea of split of work? Tasks assigned to each other?
- done solo
